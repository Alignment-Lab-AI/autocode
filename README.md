# AutoCode Project

## Overview
AutoCode is an innovative project leveraging the power of GPT-4 and OpenAI API for fully autonomous programming. The project contains a collection of various API scripts which are designed to streamline and automate the programming process. Currently, the project is not using any LangChain guidance or LLAMA index.

## Features
Currently, the project includes two key scripts:
- AutoCode Working
- AutoCode Beta

These are the only scripts that are functional at present. However, we are constantly improving and updating our repository. The end goal is to have a full suite of scripts that cover a wide range of programming tasks, all working autonomously.

## Usage
Using the scripts is as simple as calling the specific function you need within your own code, following the required parameters listed in each script's documentation.

Please note: This is a developing project. Not all features are fully tested and may not work as expected.

## Contributions
While the project is under constant development, contributions are welcomed! If you are interested in helping out, please read the contribution guidelines and feel free to submit pull requests.
